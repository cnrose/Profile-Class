			<p>I am a Kansas native, but currently reside in the Atlanta metro with my husband and 8 cats... it's a long story (but promise I'm not a crazy cat lady). I am a proud Jayhawk and graduated from the University of Kansas with a degree in Classical Languages.</p>
			<p>Although I was a high school Latin teacher for 4 years, I am now currently pursuing a career change to web development.</p>
